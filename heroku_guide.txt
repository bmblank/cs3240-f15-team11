Set up Heroku:

Go to Heroku.com and make an account

Start "Getting Started with Python on Heroku"
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python

Download and install Heroku Toolbelt

For some reason, my $PATH wasn't working so I had to run heroku command using it's full path
sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku
This might be an issue with El Capitan and rootless mode

sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku update
sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku login

Make a RSA key for heroku stuff.
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Directory: ~/.ssh/
Call it heroku_rsa
Edit ~/.ssh/config to add the following two lines:
Host git.heroku.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/heroku_rsa

sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/heroku_rsa

Change dir to a git repository you want to deploy
sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku create
(optionally pass a parameter name to specify the app name)
The create function will automatically create a git remote called heroku for the working git directory

Create a file 'Procfile' that tells Heroku how to deploy your app. For Django, the Procfile is one line:
web: gunicorn projectSite.wsgi --log-file -

Now, create a requirements.txt file so Heroku knows what the app's dependencies are:
Make sure you have the project virtual environment activated!
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

To deploy:
git push heroku master
If it asks, enter the following information:
username: [empty]
password: [auth token]
get auth token using:
sudo /usr/local/bin/heroku auth:token
