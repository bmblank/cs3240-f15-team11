What types of files should we be able to store? Text, image, audio, etc.
Are there certain files we should be able to restrict from being posted?
Is everything on the server encrypted/can you store decrypted files?
Does encryption happen on the user's local machine or on the server?
Is the only way to decrypt a file for a person to download the encrypted file to the stand alone program and decrypt it there?
